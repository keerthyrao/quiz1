Challenges Encountered During Model Training and Optimization:
A) Limited computational resources can slow down the training process.
  Finding the optimal set of parameters can be challenging it can be sometimes underfitting or overfitting
B) number of lstm layers and units can be decided based on factors such as complexity of data,presence of longterm dependencies and computational constraints.
c) preprocessing steps:
   handling missing values, normalization,train and test spliting and reshaping
d) dropout layers help improve models ability to generalize by reducing overfitting especially in small datasets
